# AdventureTourManagement
This project houses solution for a cloud web application which enables a user to book an Adventure sports activity in various parts of the country. 

The application allows user to reserve their slot for the activity as a Guest. Customers would be able to see a dashboard with three different activity trends. 

The user can directly choose a sport from the trends or can see the list of all the available activities to book from. 

A booking confirmation is sent to the user email address after email is validated by an authentication token. This is achieved with the help of a user created library Secure Access which facilitates the user authentication.

The returning users can register with the earlier provided email address to create a profile and view their past bookings.

The application is developed using .Net Core framework using MVC architecture and C# as the programming language. The application uses SQL database which is deployed on Azure Cloud.
The web application is hosted on Microsoft Azure as the PaaS cloud service provider.
